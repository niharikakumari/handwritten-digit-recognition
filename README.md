# handwritten-digit-recognition

Created my first repository.
It contains my first project in image recognition, which I did while learning Convolutional Neural Networks. It is easy enough to understand. 

Based on my experineces, I would recommend everyone to try out the techniques you learn in image recognition on MNIST dataset first, as it is a simple dataset and will give you good understanding of what is actually happening in the code.
